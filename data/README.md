I've included a few images and labels here for reproducibility testing. The model weights, test sets, and full datasets are too large for GitHub hosting; model weights and training sets can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16945379) and [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16945337), respectively. The entire dataset, which is continuously growing, can be found on [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/gent-lab/tssm-detection-v2).
