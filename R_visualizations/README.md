The .Rmd for most of the graphical visualizations in the manuscript can be found here. To reproduce the visualizations and statistical results, download the .Rmd file and the [csvs](../datasheets). Next, install any missing R packages using `install.packages([package_name])`. Finally, update the absolute paths to reflect your file structure (if necessary). A few minor aesethic alterations (e.g. adding subfigure labels) were made to some of the figures using Microscoft Powerpoint or Adobe Photoshop. 

The density plots in Fig 1 and confusion matrices (Fig 5), were created as a by-product of YOLOv11 training. Code and output from training runs can be found [here](../v209_v210_v211_train_eval.ipynb).
